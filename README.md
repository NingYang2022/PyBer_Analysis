# PyBer_Analysis

## <font color=#6495ED>Overview of Project</font>
Pybar company has given us a assignment. Using  Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, I'll create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, Iâ€™ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, I'll summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.
### <font color=#6495D>Purposes</font>

1. Create a ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type that shows information below:
    * The total number of rides for each city type
    * The total number of drivers for each city type 
    * The sum of the fares for each city type
    * The average fare per ride for each city type 
    * The average fare per driver for each city type
2.	Create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

* Data Source:
    * city_data.csv
    * ride_data.csv
* Software: Python3.9, Anaconda3, Jupyter Notebook


## <font color=#6495ED>Results</font>
- The total number of rides in rural cities is 11 to 5 times less than in urban and suburban cities, respectively.
- The total number of drivers in rural cities is 30 to 6 times less than in urban and suburban cities, respectively.
- The total fares in rural cities is 10 to 5 times less than in urban and suburban cities, respectively.
- The average fare per ride in rural cities is $10 to $4 more than in urban and suburban cities, respectively.
- The average fare per driver in rural cities is $39 to $16 more than in urban and suburban cities, respectively.
- The Data shows that the total fares are the lowest in rural cities while average fare per ride or per driver is the highest.

- The total weekly fares in rural cities is around 10 to 5 times less than in urban and suburban cities, respectively.
- The total weekly fares is going up and down every other week.

  ## <font color=#6495ED>Summary</font>  
   Based on the data and results, our recommendations are listed below: 

  - Reduce the rate of fare in rural cities to lower the average fare per ride or per driver.
  - Giving  discount to the customers in rural cities is another way of making average fare per ride or per driver lower.
  - Giving price promotion during dip period can boost sales.
